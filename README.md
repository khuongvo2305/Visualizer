# Visualizer
We would like to encourage young people to start learning computer science early. Hence, we want to have an easy, friendly way to learn about Algorithm and Data structures.
## Features
* User can see which data structures & algorithms the system can support visualizing.
* For a specific data structure, the system can visualize how it is structured, how inserting/removing work.
* For a specific algorithm - Quick Sort, the system can show how it is impolemented in a specific programing language and visualize how it works on sample data
* User can see advantages and disadvantages on each data structures or algorithm
